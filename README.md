# yomo_junior_dev_test

The purpose of this test is to evaluate the technical competence of the applicant. There is nothing in the test that is designed to trip up or catch out the candidate; it is intended to provide a typical requirement of a YoMo API endpoint.

This test will explore the following:

- Defining an API endpoint
- Consuming API endpoints
- Asynchronous programming
- Promise chains

We are not looking for the most elegant or polished solution, we are trying to understand how **you** would tackle the problem, the **steps** you would take and of course, ultimately the stability and correct operation of your code. You will have one hour to complete the task.

## Pre-requisites:

Working NodeJS, Typescript, Visual Studio Code environment, YoMo junior dev codebase

The example code to get you started can be downloaded from:

https://github.com/martinhudson/yomo_junior_dev_test

but of course you already know this...

## Executing the demo code:

npm install the dependencies and start the server (npm run serve) using nodemon.

## Requirement:

The requirement is to construct a a RESTful endpoint that returns the current conversion rate of the specified crypto currency (e.g. BTC, ETH etc.) together with its conversion rate for each of the last 7 days in JSON format.

You can use the following API endpoint:

https://rapidapi.com/alphavantage/api/alpha-vantage/

With the keys:

"x-rapidapi-host": "alpha-vantage.p.rapidapi.com",
"x-rapidapi-key": "57236deaf6msh3e65fcc8d737ce3p126afejsn7e73081453fa"

**You** must choose the most appropriate endpoint from those available in order to complete the task.
